Testing Methods
---------------

- While running client, click on different combinations of buttons: SETUP, PLAY, PAUSE,
  STOP and SESSION. Test for the correctness of standard output to see if they are the
  expected values.
- Test the DESCRIBE method to see if it is sending back correct session information.
- Simulate fluctuating connection stability by sending random fraction lost values back
  to the server via RTCP packets. The server should adjust the video quality sent back
  according the the congestion conditions.
- Similar to previous item, but test to see if the data flow rate has indeed been reduced
  by the server side congestion control algorithm.
- Run Client on FunkyServer to see if it is able synchronize dropped frames properly.
- Modify the Server code to purposely generate out of sync frames and see if the client 
  can synchronize and show appropriate frames.
- Test for correct packets drop rate statistics. By knowing a fixed amount of dropped
  packets in periodic intervals, see if the client side is showing the correct stats.
  Also check to see if the total bytes received statistic is consistent with the movie
  file size.
- Test for the correct values in header fields and body fields of RTP packets and RTCP 
  packets thats sent between the server and client.
